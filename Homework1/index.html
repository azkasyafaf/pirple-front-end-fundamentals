  <!-- Showing the Ingredients needed in Unordered List -->
  <ul>
    <li>10 chicken thighs or drumsticks (or a mix)</li>
    <li>500ml/18fl oz buttermilk (or 250ml plain yoghurt mixed with 250ml milk)</li>
    <li>100g/3½oz plain flour</li>
    <li>50g/1¾oz cornflour</li>
    <li>2 tsp ground dried oregano</li>
    <li>2 tsp chilli powder</li>
    <li>2 tsp ground dried sage</li>
    <li>2 tsp dried basil</li>
    <li>2 tsp dried marjoram</li>
    <li>2 tsp ground white pepper</li>
    <li>4 tsp table salt</li>
    <li>2 tbsp sweet paprika</li>
    <li>2 tbsp smoked paprika</li>
    <li>2 tsp onion salt</li>
    <li>2 tsp garlic powder</li>
    <li>oil, for shallow frying</li>
    <li>coleslaw, to serve</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Method</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Place the chicken pieces in a container, cover with the buttermilk and refrigerate for 12 hours.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.</li>
    <li>Mix together the flours with the dried spices and herbs on a large plate. Remove the chicken from the buttermilk and shake off as much of the buttermilk as possible. Roll the chicken pieces around in the dry mix until coated.</li>
    <li>Heat a large frying pan over a medium-low heat and add a glug of oil. Fry 2-3 pieces of chicken at a time (do not crowd the pan) until golden-brown all over and cooked through. When cooked, drain the chicken on kitchen paper and then transfer to a roasting tin.</li>
    <li>Put the chicken pieces in the oven until the coating is crunchy rather than crisp (up to 15 minutes).</li>
    <li>Serve in a basket with some coleslaw.</li>
  </ol>
